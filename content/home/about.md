# About

I am a scholar of the literary and intellectual culture of early modern Europe, especially seventeenth-century England. I specialize in the study of the reception of Greco-Roman antiquity, a field which encompasses the production of editions, translations, and interpretations of classical texts; the use of Latin as an international language of learning; classical influences in Neo-Latin and vernacular literature; and the history of humanistic scholarship and education. Other areas of interest, often intersecting with this primary emphasis, include political thought, religious controversy, the new science, and orientalism. The writings of John Milton, the subject of my doctorate, continue to be a major focus of attention. Other figures studied include Isaac Barrow, Albertus Bobovius, Thomas Creech, Johann Froben, Thomas Nashe, Henry Oldenburg, Amandus Polanus, and Sir Henry Wotton. My scholarship has been published or is forthcoming in *Philosophy and Literature*, the *Rheinisches Museum für Philologie*, *Latomus: Revue d'études latines*, *Notes & Queries*, *The Seventeenth Century*, *Reformation*, *Milton Quarterly* and multiple edited volumes. Recognized as an Associate Fellow of the Higher Education Academy in the UK for my reflective pedagogy, I have taught various subjects in departments of English, Classics, and History.
