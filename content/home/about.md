# About

I am a PhD candidate and postgraduate teacher in English Studies at the [University of Exeter](https://humanities.exeter.ac.uk/english/) associated with the [Centre for Early Modern Studies (CEMS)](https://humanities.exeter.ac.uk/history/research/centres/earlymodern/). My doctoral thesis, which I expect to submit by September 2020, is entitled *Milton, Longinus, and the Sublime in the Seventeenth Century*. My scholarship has been published or is forthcoming in *Philosophy and Literature*, the *Rheinisches Museum für Philologie*, *Latomus: Revue d'études latines*, *Notes & Queries*, *The Seventeenth Century*, and edited collections. An Associate Fellow of the [Higher Education Academy](https://www.heacademy.ac.uk/), I have taught seminars on subjects including Latin, Shakespeare, and the English Renaissance.
