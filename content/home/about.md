# About

I am a PhD candidate and postgraduate teacher in English at the [University of Exeter](https://humanities.exeter.ac.uk/english/) associated with the [Centre for Early Modern Studies (CEMS)](https://humanities.exeter.ac.uk/history/research/centres/earlymodern/). My dissertation, which I expect to submit by September 2020, is entitled *Milton and the Idea of the Sublime in the Seventeenth Century*. My scholarship has been published or is forthcoming in *Philosophy and Literature*, the *Rheinisches Museum für Philologie*, *Latomus: Revue d'études latines*, *Notes & Queries*, and *The Seventeenth Century*. An Associate Fellow of the [Higher Education Academy](https://www.heacademy.ac.uk/), I teach seminars mostly on early modern English literature.  View my full CV [here](CV_Vozar_new.pdf).
