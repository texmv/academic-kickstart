# About

I am a scholar of early modern literary, cultural, and intellectual history currently completing my PhD at the [University of Exeter](https://humanities.exeter.ac.uk/english/), where I am associated with the [Centre for Early Modern Studies](https://humanities.exeter.ac.uk/history/research/centres/earlymodern/) and the [Centre for Classical Reception](https://humanities.exeter.ac.uk/classics/research/classicalreception/). My thesis, which I expect to submit in September, is entitled *Milton, Longinus, and the Sublime in the Seventeenth Century*. My scholarship has been published or is forthcoming in *Philosophy and Literature*, the *Rheinisches Museum für Philologie*, *Latomus: Revue d'études latines*, *Notes & Queries*, *The Seventeenth Century*, *Reformation*, and multiple edited volumes. An Associate Fellow of the [Higher Education Academy](https://www.heacademy.ac.uk/), I teach modules in English, Classics, and History.  View my CV [here](pdf/CV_Vozar.pdf).
