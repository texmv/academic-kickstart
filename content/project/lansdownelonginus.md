# Project summary to display on homepage.
summary = "An important part in the history of the sublime is played by the ancient Greek treatise Περì ὕψους (*On the Sublime*) traditionally ascribed to Longinus. While it was once thought that Europeans had little knowledge of this work before the 1674 translation into French by Nicolas Boileau-Despréaux, scholarship over the past few decades has steadily accumulated more and more evidence of the text's dissemination throughout Europe in this period. This research adds to the evidence by revealing a previously unknown translation of Longinus in the Lansdowne collection of manuscripts at the British Library which may antedate Boileau's version and the translations that followed it."
