title = "Milton and the Idea of the Sublime in the Seventeenth Century"

# Project summary to display on homepage.
summary = "Though Milton has always been spoken of in terms of sublimity, scholarship has never fully considered the idea of the sublime in relation to Milton's work, no doubt because the sublime has long been perceived as a largely post-Miltonic concept first formulated in the context of eighteenth-century aesthetic theory. This doctoral research project, funded by an Exeter International Excellence Scholarship for Postgraduate Research, reexamines the evidence and argues that Milton formed an idea of the sublime from his reading of not only Longinus but various rhetorical, scientific, and theological works, an idea that profoundly informed his poetry and prose."
