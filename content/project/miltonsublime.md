# Project title.
title = "Milton and the Idea of the Sublime in the Seventeenth Century"

# Project summary to display on homepage.
summary = "Scholarship has never properly considered the writings of John Milton in relation to the idea of the sublime, no doubt because the sublime has long been perceived as a largely post-Miltonic concept first formulated in the context of eighteenth-century aesthetic theory. This doctoral research project, funded by an Exeter International Excellence Scholarship for Postgraduate Research, excavates the traces of a pre-aesthetic conception of the sublime and argues that this notion was integral to Milton's rhetorical, natural-philosophical, and theological imagination."
