title = "Milton and the Idea of the Sublime in the Seventeenth Century"

# Project summary to display on homepage.
summary = "Though Milton has always been spoken of in terms of sublimity, scholarship has never fully considered the concept of the sublime in relation to Milton's work. This is no doubt because the sublime has been perceived as a largely post-Miltonic concept first formulated in the context of eighteenth-century aesthetic theory by such figures as Edmund Burke and Immanuel Kant. This research, building on recent scholarship on the sublime in classical antiquity and the Renaissance, will provide both a historical exposition of the sublime as a pre-aesthetic concept and an exegesis of the sublime in Milton's poetry."
